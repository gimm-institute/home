We aim to create a platform for collaboration, experience sharing, and dissemination of practical, state-of-the-art tools for macroprudential modeling and policy analysis. Connecting people GIMM aims to provide a platform for practitioners who have to deal with real-life problems on a daily basis. We aim to complement the numerous existing platforms focusing on research by focusing on experience-sharing, connecting practitioners across different institutions, and disseminating state-of-the-art tools. Our workshops are most beneficial for experts tasked with producing regular outputs for consumption by policy makers: stress scenarios, analysis of macroprudential interventions, and similar. Building macroprudential modeling tools GIMM has developed a modeling framework for the analysis of macro-financial linkages, financial stabilitiy, and macroprudential policy. The framework provides two-way interactions between macro and the financial system with endogenous feedbacks. Following a top-down model building strategy, the framework allows the users to look at the financial system as a whole and describe its aggregate behavior, big-picture interactions between macroeconomy and financial sector. Its flexible structure makes it possible to analyze a wide range of financial stability and macroprudential policy scenarios as well as to gauge the impact of macroeconomic scenarios on the financial sector. Generating global scenarios GIMM is constructing a semi-structural multi-area model framework for a regular production and dissemination of scenarios of global macroeconomic and financial stress. The framework is designed to maintain a good balance between solid theoretical consistency and empirical relevance.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#about-us","text":"We are a non-profit research institute bringing together central banks and other institutions tasked with financial stability.

The framework is built on insights from large-scale DSGE models, such as the MAPMOD , but great care has been placed on keeping the framework simple, flexible, and operable. The framework consists of several modules that can be added, removed, or modified as needed. The framework includes several nonlinearities which are essential for macroprudential modeling and analysis of macroprudential policy. The framework is therefore able to simulate a wide range of macroprudential policy interventions and allows not only for theoretical, shock-minus-control simulations starting from equilibrium, but also allows us to build simulations based on the current state of the economy and macroeconomic forecast. Use cases: Conceptual simulations, in particular policy interventions simulations, to recive insights as to how a particular policy impacts the financial sector and macroeconomy. Data-based projections, scenarios consistent with macroeconomic assumptions (e.g. central bank macro forecast) and the current state of the financial sector. Shock-minus-control scenarios, built on top of a baseline: consistent picture of shock impact on the macroeconomy and financial sector, taking into account the current state of the financial sector. Steady state analysis (comparative static) to understand how changes in structural features (parameters) impact the economy and the transition between the two states. The framework is continually developed and updated.","title":"Macrofinancial stability model"},{"location":"know-how/model/#macrofinancial-stability-model","text":"GIMM has developed an in-house modeling framework designed for medium-term dynamic macro-financial analysis, complete with two-way macro-financial interactions, key nonlinearities, and a range of possible macroprudential policies.
