We aim to create a platform for collaboration, experience sharing, and dissemination of practical, state-of-the-art tools for macroprudential modeling and policy analysis. Connecting people GIMM aims to provide a platform for practitioners who have to deal with real-life problems on a daily basis. We aim to complement the numerous existing platforms focusing on research by focusing on experience-sharing, connecting practitioners across different institutions, and disseminating state-of-the-art tools. Our workshops are most beneficial for experts tasked with producing regular outputs for consumption by policy makers: stress scenarios, analysis of macroprudential interventions, and similar. Building macroprudential modeling tools GIMM has developed a modeling framework for the analysis of macro-financial linkages, financial stabilitiy, and macroprudential policy. The framework provides two-way interactions between macro and the financial system with endogenous feedbacks. Following a top-down model building strategy, the framework allows the users to look at the financial system as a whole and describe its aggregate behavior, big-picture interactions between macroeconomy and financial sector. Its flexible structure makes it possible to analyze a wide range of financial stability and macroprudential policy scenarios as well as to gauge the impact of macroeconomic scenarios on the financial sector. Generating global scenarios GIMM is constructing a semi-structural multi-area model framework for a regular production and dissemination of scenarios of global macroeconomic and financial stress. The framework is designed to maintain a good balance between solid theoretical consistency and empirical relevance.","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#about-us","text":"We are a non-profit research institute bringing together central banks and other institutions tasked with financial stability.
