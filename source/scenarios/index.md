# :fontawesome-solid-chart-column:  Global scenarios


GIMM is developing a semi-structural multi-area model framework for a regular
production and dissemination of scenarios of global macroeconomic and
financial stress. The framework is designed to maintain a good balance
between solid theoretical consistency and empirical relevance.

The global scenarios are available to the GIMM members via the [**Member
zone**](https://github.com/gimm-institute/member-zone).

Use cases for the global scenarios:

* Conceptual inputs into the discussion and analysis of the sources of
  major shocks hitting individual regions, countries, and economies.

* Quantitative inputs into national stress scenarios, with internal
  consistency of globall macroeconomic and macrofinancial variables.

* Simulation assumptions into macroprudential policy analysis and advice,
  constituting e.g. a basis for a complete macrofinancial boom-bust cycle.
