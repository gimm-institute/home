# :fontawesome-solid-pen:Â Model-based analysis using EBA stress test inputs

### Logistics

Preliminary Dates:  February / March 2023, three day event

Place: Prague, Czech Republic

Charge: 

* Free of charge for participants from GIMM member institutions
* TBD for participants from non-member institutions

Participation limited to 30 persons

Participants will be required to run codes in Matlab

### Preliminary program

* Introduction to model-based stress testing versus model-based macroprudential policy analysis
* Static vs dynamic vs behavioral analysis, the role of expectations in stress scenarios
* Integrating the macro assumptions and the financial assumptions in EBA scenarios
* Reproducing and interpreting EBA scenarios within a macroprudential model
* Incorporating EBA scenarios as external assumptions
* Creating delta scenarios based on EBA for macroprudential analysis, designing simple macroprudential reaction
