Modeling approach:

Explicit concepts of supply and demand (aggregate, credit, etc.) closely
follow theoretically-consistent models, but deviate where necessary for
tractability and operability. 


Modular approach to model-building makes it possible to add and remove
individual modeling blocks, making it easy to tailor the framework for a
particular economy. 
The key feature of the framework is a set of nonlinearities that
approximate real-world behavior and make the model suitable for analysis of
macroprudentail policy and trade-offs involved.

Use cases:

* Conceptual simulations, in particular policy interventions simulations,
to recive insights as to how a particular policy impacts the financial
sector and macroeconomy.


* Data-based projections, scenarios consistent with macroeconomic
assumptions (e.g. central bank macro forecast) and the current state of
the financial sector.


* Shock-minus-control scenarios, built on top of a baseline: consistent
picture of shock impact on the macroeconomy and financial sector,
taking into account the current state of the financial sector.


* Steady state analysis (comparative static) to understand how changes in
structural features (parameters) impact the economy and the transition
between the two states.
