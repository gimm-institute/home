We are a non-profit research
institute bringing together central banks and other institutions tasked
with financial stability. We aim to create a platform for
collaboration, experience sharing, and dissemination of practical,
state-of-the-art tools for macroprudential modeling and policy analysis.

## What do we do?

#### :fontawesome-solid-user-group:  Connecting people

> GIMM aims to provide a platform for practitioners who have to deal with
> real-life problems on a daily basis. We aim to complement the numerous
> existing platforms focusing research by focusing on experience-sharing,
> connecting practitioners across different institutions, and disseminating
> state-of-the-art tools. Our workshops are most beneficial for experts
> tasked with producing regular outputs for consumption by policy makers: stress
> scenarios, analysis of macroprudential interventions, and similar.


#### :fontawesome-solid-cube:  Building macroprudential modeling

> GIMM is developing a modeling framework for the analysis of
> macro-financial linkages, financial stabilitiy, and macroprudential
> policy. The framework provides two-way interactions between macro and the
> financial system with endogenous feedbacks. Following a top-down model
> building strategy, the framework allows the users to look at the
> financial system as a whole and describe its aggregate behavior,
> big-picture interactions between macroeconomy and financial sector. Its
> flexible structure makes it possible to analyze a wide range of financial
> stability and macroprudential policy scenarios as well as to gauge the
> impact of macroeconomic scenarios on the financial sector.
