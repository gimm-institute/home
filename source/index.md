We are a non-profit research
institute bringing together central banks and other institutions tasked
with financial stability. We aim to create a platform for
collaboration, experience sharing, and dissemination of practical,
state-of-the-art tools for macroprudential modeling and policy analysis.

## What do we do?

#### :fontawesome-solid-user-group:  Connecting people

> GIMM aims to provide a platform for practitioners who have to deal with
> real-life problems on a daily basis. We aim to complement the numerous
> existing platforms focusing research by focusing on experience-sharing,
> connecting practitioners across different institutions, and disseminating
> state-of-the-art tools. Our workshops will be most beneficial for experts
> tasked with producing regular, policymakers-facing outputs: stress
> scenarios, analysis of macroprudential interventions, and similar.


#### :fontawesome-solid-cube:  Building macroprudential modeling

> The GIMM is developing a modeling framework for analysis of macro-financial
> linkages and macroprudential policy. The framework provides two-way
> interactions between macro and the financial system with endogenous
> feedbacks. Following top-down model building strategy, the framework allows
> us to look at the financial system as a whole and describe the aggregate
> behavior, big picture interactions between macroeconomy and financial
> sector. Flexible structure allows to analyze a wide range of
> macroprudential policy interventions as well as impact of macroeconomic
> scenarios on the financial sector.
